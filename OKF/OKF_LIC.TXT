OKF Font Engine and OKF File Format GP32 License:
-------------------------------------------------
 
In order to use the OKF Font Engine and the OKF File Format you must
be in agreement with the following conditions:
 
  - You must explicitly cite the OKF Font Engine or the OKF File Format, and
    its author in your product's documentation AND in your software.
    Two possible examples, but not limited to, are:
 
      Uses the OKF Font Engine by Guillem Reinoso (Oankali).
      Copyright (c) 2004.
 
      Uses OKF Fonts by Guillem Reinoso (Oankali).
      Copyright (c) 2004.
 
  - The OKF File Format is free and its purpose is to offer free fonts to the
    community, so that any font that follows the OKF File Format Specification
    is also free and may be used by all the community.
    This implies that even if an OKF Font is copyrighted and included in
    commercial software, everybody is automatically granted permission to take
    or extract the OKF Font and use it for his own purposes, even if it is
    embedded in a binary file. This also means that an OKF Font may not be
    encrypted or compressed if there is no public program to decrypt or
    uncompress the font.
    On the users side, the taken or extracted OKF Font and its designer must be
    explicitly cited in the user's software and/or the user's documentation as
    the font will remain the property of its designer.
  
  - The OKF Font Engine and/or OKF Fonts may be used freely in commercial
    software only for software that runs on the Game Park GP32 handheld video
    console, and provided that one complete registered copy (packaged and with
    manuals where applicable) is sent to the author of the OKF Font Engine and
    the OKF File Format.
    For the conditions of commercial use of the OKF Font Engine and/or OKF
    Fonts in other platforms, please contact the author.
